# Cline Project Documentation

## Overview
Cline is a VSCode extension that provides an autonomous coding agent capable of creating/editing files, running commands, using the browser, and more with user permission every step of the way. The extension integrates with multiple AI providers and implements a human-in-the-loop approach for safe automation.

## Core Architecture

### Extension Core
- Main extension entry point (`extension.ts`) handling activation and command registration
- ClineProvider managing webview UI and state
- Core Cline class implementing AI assistant logic
- Human-in-the-loop approval system for all operations

### API Integration
- Multiple provider support:
  - Anthropic (Claude 3.5 Sonnet with prompt caching)
  - OpenAI/Azure OpenAI
  - OpenRouter (multi-model support)
  - Google Gemini
  - AWS Bedrock
  - Local models via Ollama
- Stream handling for real-time responses
- Token usage and cost tracking
- Prompt caching system with breakpoint optimization
- Automatic context window management
- Efficient token usage through sliding window conversations

## Tools System

### File Operations
- Create and edit files with diff view
- Read file contents with binary file support
- Search files using regex with context
- List files and directories
- Parse code definitions using tree-sitter
- Automatic directory creation
- File change validation and safety checks
- Timeline tracking for all modifications

### Terminal Integration
- Advanced shell integration with VSCode
- Command execution and output streaming
- Process state management
- Background task handling
- Terminal pooling and reuse
- Output formatting and sanitization
- Error recovery mechanisms
- Shell integration feature detection
- Known Limitations:
  - Shell integration may have formatting issues with commas
  - Some commands may require specific environment setup
  - Background processes require manual termination
  - Output streaming may have delays

### Browser Automation
- Headless browser control via Puppeteer
- Screenshot capture
- Console log monitoring
- Mouse/keyboard interaction
- Navigation and scrolling
- Page state monitoring
- Error handling and recovery
- Session cleanup
- Known Limitations:
  - Fixed viewport size (900x600)
  - Single browser instance at a time
  - Must close browser before using other tools
  - Limited to basic interactions (click, type, scroll)

### Context Management
- Maintains conversation history
- Handles token limits
- Supports prompt caching
- Manages environment details
