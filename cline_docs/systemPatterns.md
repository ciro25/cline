# System Patterns

## High-level architecture

* Cline uses a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to analyze user input and generate code
* The system consists of several components, including a user interface, a code generator, and a code executor

## Core technical patterns

* Cline uses a microservices architecture to separate the different components of the system
* The system uses a service-oriented architecture (SOA) to enable communication between the different components
* Cline uses a database to store user data and code snippets
