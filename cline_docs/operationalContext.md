# Operational Context

## How the system runs

* The system runs on a cloud-based infrastructure (AWS)
* The system uses a containerization platform (Docker) to manage dependencies and ensure consistency

## Error handling patterns

* The system uses a centralized logging platform (ELK) to collect and analyze logs
* The system uses a monitoring platform (Prometheus) to track performance and detect issues
* The system uses an alerting platform (PagerDuty) to notify teams of issues

## Infrastructure details

* The system uses a relational database (PostgreSQL) to store user data and code snippets
* The system uses a caching layer (Redis) to improve performance
* The system uses a load balancer (HAProxy) to distribute traffic

## Performance requirements

* The system must be able to handle a minimum of 100 concurrent users
* The system must be able to process a minimum of 100 requests per second
* The system must have a response time of less than 500ms
