## 🎯 Deciding What to Work On

See something that could be improved? Feel free to create a pull request directly! Whether it's fixing a typo or adding a cool new AI feature, we love surprises (the good kind, not the "undefined is not a function" kind).

If you're planning to work on a bigger feature, please create an issue first so we can discuss whether it aligns with Cline's vision.
